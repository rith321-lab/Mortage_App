# Project Requirements Document

This document outlines an AI-Driven Mortgage Underwriting Solution designed to dramatically streamline the mortgage pre-approval process for home buyers and lenders. Home buyers often endure lengthy, repetitive applications with multiple lenders, while lenders suffer from redundant paperwork and inefficient risk assessments. This solution leverages AI to gather, verify, and process borrower information in one single application, generating a partially underwritten pre-approval in less than 24 hours. By applying Fannie Mae’s underwriting guidelines automatically, it aims to reduce turnaround time and eliminate the hassle of repetitive document submissions.

The platform is being built to provide both speed and efficiency. For borrowers, it means faster, more straightforward applications and quick access to multiple lender offers. For lenders, the benefit is receiving a complete and ready-to-underwrite package for each applicant, avoiding redundant checks. Key objectives include speedy pre-approvals, compliance with industry standards, an intuitive digital experience (including digital signatures), and robust security measures to protect sensitive data. Success will be measured by user satisfaction, the volume of processed applications, reduction in turnaround times, and reliable integration with third-party services.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A single digital application flow where home buyers submit personal, financial, and employment information along with uploading required documents only once.
*   An AI-based underwriting engine that assesses applications using Fannie Mae guidelines, calculating key metrics like debt-to-income ratio, creditworthiness, and loan-to-value ratios.
*   Integration with lender databases via secure APIs that allow real-time matching of applications with available loan products and interest rate comparisons.
*   Automated document verification using OCR and secure document storage, accessible to all authorized lenders.
*   Digital signature capabilities integrating popular platforms (e.g., DocuSign or Adobe Sign) for legally compliant e-signatures.
*   User-friendly dashboards for both home buyers and lenders, ensuring real-time status updates and notifications (email, SMS, in-app) throughout the process.
*   Compliance with security standards (data encryption, secure API integrations, and multi-factor authentication) and support for multilingual user interfaces.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced post-MVP features such as AI-driven loan optimization suggestions that advise borrowers on improving their loan terms.
*   Expanded integration with alternative lenders or non-traditional financing products.
*   Extensive predictive analytics for lenders beyond basic reporting and insights.
*   Custom or unique branding guidelines if there are any changes; the solution will initially adhere to a clean, modern fintech style.
*   In-depth custom integrations beyond standard API usage (unless specifically needed for compliance adjustments).
*   Deep customization for specific reporting needs, with initial reports providing aggregated insights rather than detailed individual-level analytics.

## User Flow

A new home buyer begins the journey by accessing a unified digital application available on both web and mobile platforms. They enter their personal details, income, employment information, and financial assets in one place and upload necessary documents (such as pay stubs, W-2s, bank statements, and IDs) via a secure portal. Once submitted, the data is securely stored and immediately picked up by the AI underwriting engine. This engine runs background verifications—pulling credit reports, confirming income through bank data, and cross-checking employment history—ensuring that all provided information is accurate and valid.

After processing the data, the AI system evaluates the application using Fannie Mae compliant guidelines, calculates key underwriting metrics, and generates a pre-approval decision. The complete application package (including verified documents and credit reports) is then distributed to participating lenders through secure API integrations. Lenders are notified via their respective dashboards or integrated systems where they review the application and generate personalized loan offers. The home buyer then receives and compares these offers in their user dashboard, with real-time notifications keeping all parties informed at every step, ensuring a seamless, transparent, and efficient process.
