Okay, I understand. You want to adapt the existing codebase and chosen tech stack to align with the refined PRD, rather than proposing entirely new technologies. Let's analyze the existing code and map it to the PRD requirements, identifying gaps and suggesting modifications.

Here's a breakdown of how we'll approach this, followed by a section-by-section analysis:

1. Review Existing Tech Stack and Code:

Frontend: React + TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, React Router, React Hook Form + Zod, Axios, (possibly) Supabase.

Backend: (Currently in development, planned) Express.js, PostgreSQL, potentially TypeORM (based on initial backend code), AWS SDK, Supabase (for Auth - we'll need to re-evaluate this).

Overall: Monorepo structure (frontend and backend).

2. Map PRD Requirements to Code:

We'll go through each major section of the refined PRD and relate it to the existing codebase:

User Roles and Permissions: How is this currently handled? What needs to change?

Application Intake: How does the frontend currently collect data? How will it interact with the backend and a future LOS integration?

Intelligent Document Processing: This is a major new area. We'll outline the necessary components.

AI-Powered Risk Assessment: Another major new area. We'll need to define the AI architecture.

Underwriting Dashboard: How much of this exists? What needs to be added/modified?

API Integrations: Focus on the MVP integrations (credit bureaus, basic LOS).

Technical Requirements: Confirm adherence to the existing stack and identify any necessary adjustments.

AI Specific Features How do we plan on creating/utilizing?

MVP Scope Definition: Ensure the existing code and near-term plans align with the MVP scope.

3. Identify Gaps and Modifications:

For each PRD section, we'll:

Identify Gaps: What functionality is completely missing and needs to be built from scratch?

Suggest Modifications: What existing code needs to be changed, refactored, or extended?

Prioritize: Focus on the MVP requirements first.

Detailed Analysis and Action Plan

Let's go through the PRD sections, referencing the code files you provided.

I. User Roles and Permissions:

Current Code:

frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx: Handles basic authentication (login, signup, logout) using Supabase. Includes a role field (buyer, lender, admin).

frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx: A basic route protector, but it doesn't differentiate based on roles, only authentication status.

backend/src/models/User.ts: Defines a User entity with a role field (buyer, lender, admin).

backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts: Verifies the JWT from Supabase

Gaps:

The current ProtectedRoute doesn't enforce role-based access. We need to extend it to check the user's role and restrict access to specific routes/components accordingly.

No UI for managing users or assigning roles (Admin functionality). This can be deferred post-MVP, but we need to plan for it.

No concept of fine-grained permissions (e.g., a "processor" role might have different permissions than an "originator").

Modifications:

ProtectedRoute Enhancement: Modify ProtectedRoute to accept an optional allowedRoles prop (an array of strings). Inside the component, check if the user's role is included in allowedRoles.

Backend API Changes: The backend API needs to be designed with role-based access in mind. For example, the GET /api/mortgage/applications endpoint should behave differently depending on the user's role:

Buyer: Can only see their own applications.

Loan Officer: Can see applications assigned to them.

Underwriter: Can see all applications (or a subset assigned to them).

Admin: Can see all applications.

backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts needs to pass the user object (with role)

Frontend Component Logic: Individual components will need to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's role. For example, the "Submit Application" button should only be visible to buyers.

Action Items:

Modify ProtectedRoute.

Design role-based access control in the backend API endpoints (in backend/src/controllers and backend/src/routes).

Update backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts

II. Application Intake:

Current Code:

frontend/src/pages/: Contains several form pages (PropertyDetails, IncomeEmployment, AssetsLiabilities, ReviewSubmit).

frontend/src/lib/validations/: Contains Zod schemas for form validation.

frontend/src/components/: Contains UI components for forms (Input, Select, etc.).

frontend/src/services/mortgage.service.ts: Contains placeholder functions for createApplication and updateApplication. These need to be connected to the backend.

Gaps:

No integration with a Loan Origination System (LOS). This is a major requirement for the MVP.

The current form data is saved to localStorage (useFormProgress hook). This is acceptable for a basic prototype, but for a real application, the data must be saved to the backend database.

No handling of incomplete applications (e.g., if the user leaves the form halfway through).

Modifications:

Replace localStorage with Backend API Calls: The saveFormProgress function in useFormProgress needs to be replaced with an API call to the backend (using mortgageService.updateApplication).

API Endpoint for Saving/Updating Application: The backend needs an endpoint (e.g., PUT /api/mortgage/applications/:id) to handle saving and updating application data. This endpoint should accept partial updates (only the data that has changed).

Application ID: We need a way to uniquely identify each mortgage application. The backend should generate a UUID for each new application and return it to the frontend. The frontend should store this ID and use it for all subsequent API calls related to that application.

LOS Integration (Initial Step): Start with a read-only integration. This means:

Identify a common LOS: Choose a popular LOS (e.g., Encompass) and research its API.

Create a Backend Service: Create a service in the backend (backend/src/services/los.service.ts) that handles communication with the LOS API.

Implement a "Fetch Application" Function: This function should take an application ID (or some other identifier) and retrieve the corresponding data from the LOS.

Populate the Frontend Form: When the user starts a new application, the frontend should call this backend service to fetch any existing data from the LOS and pre-populate the form fields.

Action Items:

Replace localStorage with API calls.

Create backend API endpoints for application management.

Implement basic LOS integration (read-only).

Add application ID handling.

III. Intelligent Document Processing (IDP):

Current Code:

frontend/src/components/documents/: Contains components for document upload (DocumentUpload, FileUploader).

frontend/src/api/document.ts: Contains functions for uploading documents to the backend.

backend/src/controllers/document.controller.ts: Handles document upload and storage (using AWS S3).

backend/src/db/migrations/: Contains database migrations for creating the documents table.

backend/src/db/migrations/003_add_document_processing.sql migration that sets up the structure for the OCR

Gaps:

No OCR Implementation: The current code only handles uploading and storing documents. It doesn't extract any data from them. This is the core of the IDP feature.

No Document Classification: The system doesn't automatically identify the type of document (pay stub, bank statement, etc.).

No Data Validation: The extracted data isn't validated against other data sources.

Modifications:

Integrate an OCR Library/Service: The backend needs to integrate with an OCR library (e.g., Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision API, AWS Textract).

Recommendation: Start with AWS Textract or Google Cloud Vision API. They are easier to integrate and provide good accuracy.

Create a new service in the backend (backend/src/services/ocr.service.ts) to handle OCR processing.

Modify document.controller.ts to call this service after a document is uploaded.

Update backend/src/db/migrations/003_add_document_processing.sql

Implement Document Classification:

This can be done using a combination of:

Filename Analysis: Look for keywords in the filename (e.g., "paystub," "W2").

OCR Output Analysis: Analyze the text extracted by the OCR engine to identify patterns and keywords.

Machine Learning Model: Train a machine learning model to classify documents based on their content (this is more advanced, but may be necessary for higher accuracy).

Update the documents table to store the identified document type.

Implement Data Extraction and Validation:

Define specific data points to extract for each document type (e.g., for a pay stub: employer name, gross pay, net pay, pay period dates).

Create functions in ocr.service.ts to extract these data points.

Create validation rules (e.g., "The sum of deductions must be less than the gross pay").

Store the extracted data and validation results in the documents table (in the ocr_data JSONB field).

Add processing_status and processing_errors as per the migration

Action Items:

Choose and integrate an OCR service (AWS Textract or Google Cloud Vision API).

Create backend/src/services/ocr.service.ts.

Implement document classification logic.

Implement data extraction and validation logic.

Modify document.controller.ts to trigger OCR processing.

Update the documents table schema.

IV. AI-Powered Risk Assessment:

Current Code:

backend/src/services/ai-underwriting.service.ts: Contains a placeholder calculateRiskScore function. This is where the core AI logic will reside.

Gaps:

No Actual AI Implementation: The current calculateRiskScore function is a very basic example. We need to implement a real risk assessment model.

No Integration with Data: The AI model needs to be integrated with the extracted data (from IDP) and the application data.

No Fannie Mae Guidelines: The rules engine needs to be based on Fannie Mae guidelines.

No Explainability

Modifications:

Define the AI Model:

Rules-Based System (Recommended for MVP): Start with a rules-based system. This is easier to implement, easier to understand, and easier to comply with regulations. You can translate Fannie Mae guidelines into a set of rules (e.g., "If DTI > 43%, flag as high risk").

Machine Learning Model (Future Enhancement): Later, you can explore using a machine learning model (e.g., a decision tree or a neural network) to predict risk. This would require a large dataset of historical loan applications and outcomes.

Implement the Rules Engine:

Create a new file (backend/src/services/rules.ts) to define the underwriting rules.

Each rule should be a function that takes application data as input and returns a boolean (pass/fail) and a reason (if failed).

The ai-underwriting.service.ts should call these rules and aggregate the results.

Integrate with Data:

Modify ai-underwriting.service.ts to accept the extracted data (from ocr.service.ts) and the application data (from mortgage.controller.ts) as input.

Pass this data to the rules engine.

Generate a Risk Score/Rating:

Based on the results of the rules engine, generate a risk score or rating.

Store this score/rating in the mortgage_applications table (in the ai_analysis JSONB field).

Add Explainability:

For each rule that fails, store the reason in the ai_analysis field.

Display these reasons in the underwriting dashboard.

Action Items:

Define the AI model (rules-based for MVP).

Implement the rules engine (backend/src/services/rules.ts).

Integrate the AI model with the data.

Generate a risk score/rating.

Store the AI analysis results in the database.

Add explainability features.

V. Underwriting Dashboard:

Current Code

frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx: Currently shows navigation options.

Gaps:

No Application Data Display: The dashboard needs to display a list of applications and their status.

No Details View: Clicking on an application should show a detailed view with all the extracted data, documents, and AI analysis.

No Filtering/Sorting: Underwriters need to be able to filter and sort applications.

No Communication Features: No way for underwriters and processors to communicate.

Modifications:

Create Dashboard Components: Create new components (e.g., ApplicationList, ApplicationDetails) to display application data.

Fetch Data from Backend: Use react-query (or similar) to fetch application data from the backend API. The frontend should not access the database directly.

Implement Filtering/Sorting: Add UI controls for filtering and sorting applications. These controls should update the query parameters sent to the backend API.

Implement Communication (Basic): Add a simple notes section to the ApplicationDetails view. This can be stored in the mortgage_applications table (e.g., in a notes JSONB field).

VI. API Integrations:

Current Code:

frontend/src/lib/api.ts sets up an Axios instance.

Credit Reporting Agencies:

Research APIs: Familiarize yourself with the APIs of Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. They typically have developer portals with documentation.

Backend Service: Create a service in the backend (backend/src/services/credit.service.ts) to handle communication with the credit bureaus.

Authentication: You'll likely need to obtain API keys and implement authentication.

Data Retrieval: Implement functions to fetch credit reports (based on the borrower's consent).

Data Parsing: Parse the credit report data and store the relevant information in the database.

Trigger: Trigger the credit report pull after the borrower has submitted the application and provided consent.

Loan Origination Systems (LOS): (See Section II - Application Intake)

VII. Technical Requirements:

The existing tech stack (React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL) is generally well-suited for this project.

FastAPI (Python): Consider using FastAPI for the backend, especially for the AI components. It's very efficient and has excellent support for asynchronous operations, which are important for handling OCR and AI processing. However, sticking with Node.js/Express is also viable if you're more comfortable with that.

Cloud Platform Choice: AWS, Google Cloud and Azure all would work.

VIII. AI Specific Features:

Current Code: Minimal

Gaps:

Document Understanding: Need to train the models for document understanding.

Data Validation: Need to implement rules and cross-validation checks.

Explainability: The AI should provide clear explanations for its recommendations, ideally integrated within the dashboard.

Continuous Learning: The AI should learn from underwriter feedback, retraining and refining itself.

Action Items

Implement the missing AI features.

Set up a process and location to store training data.

IX. MVP Scope Definition:

The current codebase provides a starting point for the frontend, but significant work is needed to implement the core features.

The backend is largely undeveloped and needs to be built according to the PRD.

Prioritize the MVP features outlined in the PRD.

Summary of Key Action Items (Prioritized for MVP):

Backend Setup: Establish the basic Express.js (or FastAPI) backend, connect it to PostgreSQL, and define the initial database schema (users, applications, documents).

Authentication: Refine the existing Supabase authentication to handle roles and secure API endpoints.

Application Intake (Backend): Create API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting mortgage applications (/api/mortgage/applications).

Application Intake (Frontend): Connect the existing form pages to the backend API, replacing localStorage with API calls.

Document Upload: Refine the existing document upload functionality (using AWS S3).

OCR Integration (Backend): Integrate with AWS Textract or Google Cloud Vision API. Implement basic document classification and data extraction.

Rules Engine (Backend): Implement the initial set of underwriting rules (Fannie Mae guidelines).

AI Underwriting Service (Backend): Connect the OCR service, rules engine, and application data to generate a preliminary risk assessment.

Underwriting Dashboard (Frontend): Build the basic dashboard UI to display application data, extracted information, and AI results.

Credit Bureau Integration (Backend): Implement basic integration with one credit bureau (e.g., Experian).

LOS Integration (Backend - Read-Only): Implement basic read-only integration with one LOS (e.g., Encompass).

Testing: Write unit and integration tests for the core backend services and frontend components.

This revised plan focuses on building a functional MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition. It prioritizes the essential features and provides a clear roadmap for development. Remember to iterate frequently, gather feedback, and adjust the plan as needed.
